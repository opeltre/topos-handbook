    "The [topos] library relies on category theory abstractions\n",
    "most common in functional languages, \n",

    "\n",
    "As first motivating example, let us mention the category ${\\bf Type}$ \n",
    "implemented by a functional language. \n",
    "Its _objects_ are constructible variable types $A$  \n",
    "and its _arrows_ represent typed programs $f : A \\to B$ with input in $A$ and \n",
    "output in $B$, constructible here meaning accepted by the language compiler.\n",

    "The concepts of categories, functors and natural transformations \n",

    "topological structures. \n",
    "\n",
    "The python language, although great for its ecosystem, does not lend itself easily to functorial constructs and type polymorphism. \n",
    "The [topos] package hence relies on the [fp] package, a small stand-alone \n",
    "consisting mostly of metaclass definitions and providing typed tensors \n",
